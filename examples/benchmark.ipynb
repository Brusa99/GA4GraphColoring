    "In this notebook we compare the performance of the two genetic algorithms against each other and against a random search and a dynamic programming algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simple benchmark and should not be taken as a definitive proof of the performance of the algorithms.\n",
    "A more proper benchmark would require a more extensive set of tests and a more detailed analysis of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that the genetic algorithms are stochastic and the results may vary from run to run.\n",
    "As such multiple runs should be performed to have a more accurate estimate of the performance of the algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, other factors other than time should be considered to assess the quality of an algorithmm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On genetic algorithms implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project was to implement genetic algorithms for the graph coloring problem.\n",
    "We implemented a problem-specific version of the algorithm that requires fewer generations to converge.\n",
    "Pure **time** performance was not the main goal of the project.\n",
    "As such the implementation could be improved to be faster.\n"

    "The _dynamic programming_ algorithm is the fastest.\n",
    "Both _dynamic programming_ and _smart GA_ algorithms are able to find the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "As expected, the _random search_ algorithm is  not able to find the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _standard GA_ algorithm is not able to find the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of generations.\n",
    "This is probably due to the fact that the algorithm gets stuck in a local optima. To reach the global optima many vertexes need to change color at the same time, which is unlikely to happen in a single generation.\n"

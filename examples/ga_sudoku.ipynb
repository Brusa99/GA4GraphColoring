    "# GA Sudoku Solver\n",
    "\n",
    "With some minor modifications, we can use the GA algorithm implemented for graph coloring to solve Sudoku puzzles.\n",
    "To do this we need to modify the mutation function to ensure that the given cells are not overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sudoku Board\n",
    "\n",
    "The sudoku board is a 9x9 grid with some cells filled with numbers from 1 to 9.\n",
    "The class `Sudoku` is used to represent the board and contains the attribute `value_matrix` which represents the cells.\n",
    "To represent an empty cell, the value 0 is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sudoku as graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "The sudoku board can be considered as an 81 vertex graph with a fixed adjacency matrix.\n",
    "The edjes are the constraints that the numbers must satisfy, namely:\n",
    "- Each row must have all numbers from 1 to 9\n",
    "- Each column must have all numbers from 1 to 9\n",
    "- Each 3x3 subgrid must have all numbers from 1 to 9\n",
    "\n",
    "## GA adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "The GA algorithm is adapted from the graph coloring problem.\n",
    "An individual of the population is a 81 element arrays, but some elements are fixed to the values of the given sudoku board and as such they can't mutate.\n",
    "The possible values for each element are the numbers from 1 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitness function is not varied. Blocked cells **do** count towards the fitness of the individual.\n",
    "The mutation function is modified to ensure that the given cells are not overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The code works in the following way:\n",
    "1. A completed sudoku puzzle is generated.\n",
    "2. Some cells are randomly cleared to create a puzzle.\n",
    "3. GA is used to solve the puzzle.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is able to solve sudoku puzzle but it is not efficient.\n",
    "Other optimization techniques are more suitable for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is shown in [1] that larger populations and more generations are required to solve more difficult puzzles.\n",
    "Confirming these results is far from the scope of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements and further work\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm can also be used to create new puzzles.\n",
    "To do this an empty sudoku board is created and the GA algorithm is used to fill it, which is equivalent to find a 9 coloring of the associated graph.\n",
